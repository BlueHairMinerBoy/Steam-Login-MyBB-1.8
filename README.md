Steam-Login-MyBB-1.8
===================
This is a fork of https://github.com/stewartiee/Steam-OpenID--MyBB-/ version 1.6
The direction veriosn 2.0 of this repository does not go quite in the direction I would want and therefore this fork.
This is mainly a collections of fixes and adjustments for the version 1.6

**Please Note!** - This plugin will only work for MyBB 1.8

This plugin will replace the base functionality of registering and logging in by default. The code is pretty self explanitory so you can change this to work alongside etc.

To install copy all files to your server and enable both the 'Display Usernames' and 'Steam Login' plugins.
You will need a Steam API key to use the 'Steam Login' plugin. You can configure your key in the Settings menu in administration panel.
